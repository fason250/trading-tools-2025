### Timeline:

## 🎯 Your Goal

**From $32 to $100 in 3-4 months**

How?
- Risk 2% per trade ($0.64)
- Win 60% of trades at 1:2 R:R
- Take 3-5 trades per week
- Compound your profits

Math:
- 5 trades/week × 16 weeks = 80 trades
- 60% win rate = 48 wins, 32 losses
- 48 wins × $1.28 = $61.44 profit
- 32 losses × $0.64 = $20.48 loss
- Net: $61.44 - $20.48 = **$40.96 profit**
- $32 + $40.96 = $72.96

**Even with conservative estimates, you can double your account in 4-6 months.**

Then keep compounding from there.
